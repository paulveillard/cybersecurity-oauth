- The OAuth 2.0 is a framework that allows third-party applications to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner (basically a user) by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service (typically a content provider, such as a social network), or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.
