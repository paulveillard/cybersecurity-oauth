# OAuth 2.0 & OIDC Fundamentals for Authentication & Authorization

**Architects and Developers** simply can’t build modern applications without running into issues of authorization and authentication.

OAuth 2.0 is an industry standard for “delegated authorization” which is the ability to provide an application or client access to data or features offered by another app or service.
